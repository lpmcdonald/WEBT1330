				  <h1>DONATING TO THE FOUNDATION</h1>
					<p>The Watermann Gallery is a non-profit organization, and is run entirely by donations and sales of gallery merchandise. Because we do not accept public funding, the gallery relies on contributions from businesses and individuals to maintain our high standards and dedication to keeping art and history accessible to the public.</p>

					<p>All donations are welcome, and can be dropped off at the Gallery business office. Gold-level donors (over $1000) are prominently listed in the gallery foyer, and on all Gallery collateral printed in the same calendar year of the donation.</p>

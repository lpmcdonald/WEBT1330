    <h2>Summer Tutoring program</h2>
		<br>
      <h4>Many students have a difficult time retaining their studies through several months of summer break. The Girls &amp; Boys Club offers tutoring in a number of subjects, including basic math, algebra, reading comprehension, and writing skills. Tutoring groups meet for one hour, in groups of no more than five Club members.</h4>
    <h4>All tutors are volunteers who have been certified by the State Board of Education. There is no cost for small-group tutoring services, although spaces are limited. Private tutoring is also available at a minimal cost (or in exchange for volunteer work at the Club facility).<br>

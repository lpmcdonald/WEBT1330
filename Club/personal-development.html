    <h2>Personal Development Program</h2>
    <p>At the Girls &amp; Boys Club, we try to offer programs to fill the gaps that are not being addressed in many inner-city public schools. We offer volunteer-led classes in a number of fields, including:</p>
    <p>Smart Girls - A health, fitness, prevention/education and self-esteem enhancement program for girls ages 8 to 17.</p>
    <p>Triple Play - Emphasizes good nutrition, regular physical activity, and improving overall well-being.</p>
    <p>Goals For Graduation - Designed to enhance Club membersâ€™ engagement with learning by providing consistent support from caring and trusted adults in developing the academic, emotional and social skills needed to achieve academic success.</p>
    <p>Money Matters - Promotes financial responsibility and independence among Club members. Participants learn how to manage a checking account, create a budget, save and invest, and pay for college.</p>
    <p>Image Makers - Encourages Club members to learn about black-and-white, color, digital and alternative process photography. The ImageMakers National Photography Program Resource Guide is full of fun, creative activity ideas</p>
    <p>Fine Arts Exhibit - Encourages artistic expression among Club members through drawing, painting, printmaking, collage, mixed media and sculpture displayed at local and regional exhibits. </p>
    <p>Drama Matters - A drama education program that encourages Club members ages 6 to 18 to engage in hands-on activities. Drama education builds self-confidence, sparks creativity and boosts academic achievement.</p>
    <p>Keystone Club - A unique teen leadership development experience provides opportunities for young people aged 14-18.</p>
    <p>Family Plus - Enables Clubs to partner with families and collaborate with other community agencies to ensure the positive development of youth through programming, resources and support.<br>
      </p>
    <p>There is no cost to attend, and all necessary materials will be provided.</p>
